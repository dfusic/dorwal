       <h1 class="wow fadeIn">Creativity</h1>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">There is no uncreative person!</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">Every human being possesses an inborn creativity, already during</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">the birth the creativity is embedded into the human being - it has</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">been given to him.</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">During a person's life the creativity gets strengthened, developed</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">and extended, it gets more and more obvious, especially for</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">people who are engaged in creative activity.</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">Unfortunately, some people don't develop their personal</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">creativity, so it gets extinguished day by day, until it finnaly</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">compeletely vanished. Concerning the fact that creativity has</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">been given to the human being since birth there is no obstacles</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">which could prevent it from further development throughout the</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">human life. There are no class obstacle, which means that you</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">don't need to be materially rich in order to achieve progress</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">concerning your creativity, in order to achieve progress</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">however material wealth can help creativity develop because it</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">gets easier to carry out your creation (thought - idea)</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">Poorer finanicial status can also be helpful for the development of</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">creativity. It can in this case be strengthened and inspired by the</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">invention of various ways to improve out financial situation. I</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">stress this on purpose - the fact that creativity has been given to us</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">so generously does not imply that every person will develop their</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">own creativity to the same extent, or that they will use it at all.</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">Thus, some people can implement their creativity easily.</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">That is: invent and realize the invented, whereas some other</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">people simply don't succeed in inventing something and</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">additionally to carry it out. Such, less creative peope sometimes</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">need a helping hand, a stimulus, to overcome the state of un-</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">creativity and to prevent their creativity from getting extinguished</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">day by day and finally from dying out.</p>

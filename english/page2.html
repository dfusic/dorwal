       <h1 class="wow fadeIn">Talent</h1>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">There is no person without a talent!</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">Just like creativity has been given to every human being, in the</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">same way we have been given a talent, that is: the possibility to</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">create whatever we can think of.</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">Someone has a talent for writing poetry or scientific books,</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">somebody for singing, playing music, someone else for designing</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">different things and all the rest surrouding us. For all this we</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">need creativity because it is creativity that accompanies every</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">single talent.</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">Thus creativity and talent are closely related. Creativity has no</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">meaning if we are not talented and talents have no value if we are</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">not creative, but fortunately there is no such assumption (we</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">are just supposing how it would be).</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">Thus creativity enriches and improves every talent seperately. It</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">forms it like a raw diamond until it becomes a superfine polished</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">diamond. This is how creativity, strongly connected to talent,</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">works in every human being. It perfects the possibility to create</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">what we are taleted for, to creaete in a better way and in higher quality.</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">As i alredy mentioned, nobody has a talent for everything, it is</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">possible to have more of them, but not all, which in fact is good</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">because if everyone would be talented for everything, people</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">would not need each other many more. So what would be the sense</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">of human existence?</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">To have several talent or just one that has been given us for</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">certain, does not mean that we can perfect them or it without</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">stimulating our creativity. Strongly expressed creativity</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">shrotens the time we need to perfect each single talent, whereas</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">less strongly expressed creativity, not only perfects the talent</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">more slowly, but it neglects it completely, so that we lose such</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">wonderfull gift. Many people whose creativity is less strongly</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">expressed, have a certain talent and believe that they can perfect it</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">and they also want to implement it, primarly to their own</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">please, but also to the pleasure of others. They need a helping</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">hand, a stimulus to overcome the state in which it is impossible to</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">create, so they develop their personal creativity, step by step and</p>
        <p class="wow fadeIn">perfect their talent.</p>

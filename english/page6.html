       <h1 class="wow fadeIn">The procedure of reproducing a drawing as a unique examplar</h1>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">The procedure of reproducing a drawing as a unique examplar is</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">show on the DVD in detail. In case you don't have the</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">opportunity to print the copy from the DVD in good quality,</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">you'd better go to a print shop or a good (digital) copy shop</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">where they will print a copy of the drawing on a high-quality</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">paper without problems (for the pastel to stick better, the paper</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">should not be smooth). Photo shops often do not have that kind of</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">paper you need, so it is desirable that you purchase it yourself.</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">In order for the reproduction to be good quality, as well as for the</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">drawing to remain clear in the minutest details, it is necessary to</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">color all the remaining parts (as shown on the DVD) with the wooden</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">pastels</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn" style="font-size:25px; margin-top:30px; margin-bottom:20px;">Why wooden pastels?</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">Very small parts of the drawing you can only paint with a well-</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">sharpened tip of a wooden pastel (wax-color). After you colored</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">the drawing in good quality and according to you wishes with</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">pastels, remove slightly the rest of the pastel from the</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">drawing (this is also shown on the DVD)</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">After having removed the rest of the pastel, you can start coloring</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">the drawing with dry pastel. In order to make the coloring simple</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">and easy, and to achieve a good quality of the transitional shade</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">of the color, use a make-up remover as well, especially if you</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">work on smaller drawing. If the drawing is bigger use a small</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">sponge, because the sponge absorbs the dry pastel in its structure</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">better than a pad. Always start with the brightest color in order to</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">achieve the proper mixture of pastels, because you cannot make</p>
       <p class="wow fadeIn">dark color bright as easily asyou can make bright color dark.</p>
